Use the ClaudePoint MCP tool to create a new checkpoint.

If arguments are provided:
- First argument: checkpoint name
- Remaining arguments: description

Example: /create-checkpoint auth-working Authentication system working perfectly

Steps:
1. Use the create_checkpoint tool from ClaudePoint
2. Pass the name and description from $ARGUMENTS if provided
3. Confirm the checkpoint was created successfully

  // Create /restore-checkpoint command
  const restoreCheckpointContent = `---
description: Restore a previous checkpoint with interactive selection
---

Help the user restore a checkpoint using ClaudePoint's restore_checkpoint tool.

Steps:
1. First, use the list_checkpoints tool to show all available checkpoints with numbering
2. Ask the user: "Which checkpoint would you like to restore? Please provide the number or name."
3. Wait for the user to respond with their selection
4. Use the restore_checkpoint tool with the selected checkpoint name
5. Confirm the restoration was successful

Important: Always show the numbered list first and wait for user selection.

Use the ClaudePoint MCP tool list_checkpoints to show all available checkpoints.

Display the results in a clear, organized format showing:
- Checkpoint name
- Description
- Date created
- Number of files
- Size
`;
  
  // Create /checkpoint-status command
  const checkpointStatusContent = `---
description: Show current checkpoint status and recent activity
---

Show the current status of checkpoints in this project using ClaudePoint tools.

Steps:
1. Use list_checkpoints to get total number of checkpoints and show the latest one
2. Use get_changelog to show recent checkpoint activity
3. Present a summary including:
   - Total number of checkpoints
   - Latest checkpoint details
   - Recent checkpoint operations (last 5 entries)
   
Format the output clearly to give a quick overview of the checkpoint system status.
